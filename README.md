# Zevi's First React + Vite + TypeScript Project

## 📌 Project Description

This is my very first project using **React**, **Vite**, and **TypeScript**. The app is a simple and clean **To-Do List** that lets users add tasks with a deadline, mark them as completed, edit task names, and remove tasks.

It was built as a learning experience to dive into TypeScript with React and to explore modern front-end development workflows using Vite.
